# EmigrantBudgetTracker
Application will track cost of buying local currencies so that the budget numbers more accurately reflect your living costs.  This is vital for currencies that fluctuate significantly.

## Project Details
Tentatively planning to have a web form that allows you to do several tasks including
- transfering money from your homeland bank account to a local account in your new country.  Track the cost of the new currency in home country value.  I.e. if you buy 20000 mxn and it costs $1097 USD including transfer fees at that current day's exchange rate, then store those values so that the funds you spend can be factored based on their actual cost in your home currency.  My current solution just checks the current conversion rate which might be quite different from when I bought the funds
- pay expenses and select which bucket of funds the expenses were paid from so that you can get the real value of funds
- allow for multiple fintech or bank accounts in multiple countries.  
- initially will only deal with two currencies but potentially could change it to manage more.
